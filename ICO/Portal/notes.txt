THINKING WITH PORTALS (Pack 1)


To use the icons, you will need to get a program like Stardock's Icon Packager.  I'm sure there are many freewares out there though, so Google is your friend if you don't have one.

To use the cursors, first save the cursor files in a safe location (where you won't accidentally delete them.)  If you have Windows, go to Control Panel > Mouse > Pointers tab.  Select the cursor you want to change and press "Browse" (or simply double-click the cursor) and select the cursor file.


While you are free to edit these icons and cursors, they are strictly for personal use only.  No commercial stuff.  If you want to redistribute them for some reason, please contact me first.  You can reach me at http://feliustanaka.deviantart.com/


Finally, if you haven't done so already, go buy Portal from Valve.  They were the ones who came up with this Portal and Aperture Laboratory stuff, and I want them to receive the full credit they deserve.


Thanks for downloading this icon pack!
