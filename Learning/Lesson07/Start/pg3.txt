Recognizing the dangers traditional farming imposes on soil fertility, organic farmers use several techniques to ensure the long-term health of the soil, including crop rotation, natural animal manure fertilizers, and planting native trees and shrubs.

Organic farms are certified and regulated on an ongoing basis, so consumers can feel confident that products labeled organic meet the highest standards of environmental friendliness and long-term sustainability.
