Jade Valley Events 

The town of Harmony, Indiana, and its surrounding region hosts events throughout the year. Jade Valley is proud to participate in and in some cases co-sponsor these events. 

Every Memorial Day weekend, Harmony hosts the Strawberry Festival. Children from all around come to Jade Valley and other farms to pick strawberries from green fields. Later, the town comes together on Main Street for live music, bar-be-que, and (of course!) strawberry pie.

Jade Valley is always well represented at the Farmer's Market. Held every Saturday morning, the Farmer's Market has dozens of stalls with fresh fruits and vegetables, flowers, popcorn, and crafts from throughout the area. Look for the Jade Valley stall each week, where we bring the best of the season directly to you.

A Harmony tradition, Picnic in the Park is an event that takes place every year in Columbus park on the last Saturday of September. Join us as we say goodbye to the hot nights of summer and welcome the equinox and the autumn harvest that follows on its heels. 

In addition to these major events, look for Jade Valley staff at Green Grocer-sponsored events (such as the semi-annual Truckload Sale), the annual 10K Run/Walk for the Cure, and Shakespeare in the Park.
