Jade Valley Products 

Jade Valley grows plants throughout the year on its farms and in its state-of-the-art greenhouse facility. We specialize in fruits and vegetables that thrive in our climate, including peppers, tomatoes, onions, apples, and herbs of all types. 

All of our fruits and vegetables are certified organic. (Learn more about organic farming here.)

At certain times of the year, we also offer special products. For example, last September, we had bumper crops of roma tomatoes and basil, so we bottled pasta sauce and sold it at the farmer's market.

Throughout the year, we also sell several varieties of home-baked, whole grain breads. Using whole-grain wheat, rather than processed white flour, results in a hearty, nutty bread that's naturally slimming.
