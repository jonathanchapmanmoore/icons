Cinnamon Baked Apples

As the cool winds of autumn blow, children play in a harvest of red, brown, and golden leaves. They rake the leaves into heaping piles and leap down into the piles from low branches. But when the raking and leaping is finished, the kids are cold and hungry.

This month's recipe is great for kids, not only because it is a delicious and nutrtious antidote to the frosty winds of November, but also because it is something they can help make!
