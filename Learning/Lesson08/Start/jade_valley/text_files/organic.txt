Organic Farming: What is it? 

Organic farming is a new approach to safe, productive, and earth-friendly farming. One of its hallmarks is its avoidance of chemical pesticides, whose long-term health effects remain a concern. 

But organic farming goes far beyond the simple avoidance of chemical pesticides. It is a whole new philosophy of farming. It places its emphasis on earth-friendly, long-term sustainable farming. Recognizing the dangers traditional farming imposes on soil fertility, organic farmers use several techniques to ensure the long-term health of the soil, including crop rotation, natural animal manure fertilizers, and planting native trees and shrubs.

Organic farms are certified and regulated on an ongoing basis, so consumers can feel confident that products labeled organic meet the highest standards of environmental friendliness and long-term sustainability.
