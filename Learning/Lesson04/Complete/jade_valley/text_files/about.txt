About Jade Valley 

Jade Valley strives to improve the health and quality of life of our community through delicious, organically grown produce; education and outreach; and community activism.

Jade Valley was founded in 1992, when longtime local residents and Anna and Will Chandler bought a family farm, northwest of Harmony. Frustrated with the quality of produce sold at the grocery chains and the limited options for healthy eating, Anna and Will embarked on an experiment to provide nutritious, environmentally sustainable, and delicious foods. 

Regular participants in the local farmer's market, and through service on the Board of the local community-owned grocer, Anna and Will have changed the way our community eats.
